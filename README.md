# Machine learning - Regression Pipelines with Pycaret and Scikit-learn

## Introduction
Scikit-learn is an established and efficient library to experiment machine learning.

Pycaret is a low code machine learning library allow users to experiment end-to-end machine learning workflows including data preparation, model training, hyperparameter tuning and model deployment in just a few lines of code.

In this repos, I will create a regression pipelines with Pycaret 3 and re-create the same pipelines using Sklearn.

## Data
[Life Expectancy](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who?select=Life+Expectancy+Data.csv)

This dataset contains data about Life Expectancy and other related facts about 183 countries from 2000 to 2015.
With the main purpose of building pipelines, EDA and Cleaning will be done at minimal level.

## Libraries to use
1. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
2. [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
3. [Pycaret 3](https://pycaret.org/)
